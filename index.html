        <p class="lead mb-4"> I have worked as Soul Purpose Dance Company’s Public Relations Coordinator for two years, and I have learned so much from the opportunity to work on the team in this instance. One task that I was especially proud of was to create a Holiday Celebration poster for our winter showcase which was completely student produced. Utilizing Canva as my primary tool, I was able to create an elegant and on theme poster that I was really proud of. With this assignment, I truly see myself working in a modern business, working as a marketing manager or a public relations coordinador. From my knowledge, this job would allow me to express my ideas creatively which is one of the most important aspects that I want out of a job. This poster shows a lot about my skills in marketing as during the creation of this poster I had a newfound intrigue of marketing and advertising, and wanted to use some of those skills. This assignment, along with many others, had given me the opportunity to produce work related to marketing and advertising, which has strengthened my skills in those areas as well as strengthened my interest in this field of study.  
<br> <br> Last summer I worked as a Sales and Marketing Group University intern at Intel, the techiest of tech companies. To explain how techy they are, this company invented the first single-chip microprocessors, which basically made the huge, gigantic practically useless computers into the ones that are used today. I worked with graphic design mainly, and I had the opportunity to network in interact with so many interesting people. One of the biggest things I’ve learned from this internship is that the environment that I worked in was not one that I particularly preferred. I had worked in a cubicle in the back of the office, and some days I would go hours without interacting with anyone, just sitting and working the whole 8-4. Being in such an enclosed, private environment had a really big effect on my mood, as going to work felt lonelier rather than fun. I would want a job that gave me more opportunities to communicate and work with others more than independent work. Being at Intel, I had the opportunity to explore the area and network with other individuals, and there were definitely jobs available there that had plenty of chances for my standards, so Intel would definitely be a place I could potentially see myself working at in the future. 
<br><br>It was at these two opportunities where I learned more about color theory and color psychology which deepened my interest with marketing because of how complex every different aspect is, and how marketing utilizes how the human mind reacts to these colors. Marketing, currently, is a career path that I am most intrigued by due to not only the ability of utilizing the more creative aspects of myself but also using psychology in order to get through to individuals. I believe that I would find myself succeeding most in this field, as I believe that I fit many of the important qualities of a marketing employee, which include: 
“Excellent communication skills, ability to make swift decisions, work through stressful situations and solve problems quickly, creative personality, and effective management and supervisory skills” (Bureau of Labor Statistics).
The list of skills that are vital in marketing are all skills that I feel confident that I exceed in. My genuine interest and passion for business direct me to believe that my current shining view on pursuing this career will lead me down a successful path in life. The skills I have currently and the skills that I look forward to acquire is making my future quite vibrant.
